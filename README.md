# find_a_flat
This crawler searches for you an apartment in Berlin. To do this, it requests the websites of the state-owned housing associations every minute and sounds an alarm when new offers arrive.
To change the search criteria, open the document "websites.txt", click on the respective URL and change the criteria on the website. Then copy the link of the new criteria and replace the URL in the "websites.txt" document.

The crawler can also be used for other cities/websites. However, the"negative expressions ("neagtiv-Ausdruecke") must be adjusted manually.
